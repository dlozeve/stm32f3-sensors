* Sensors

Experiments with the sensors of the [[https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/stm32f3discovery.html][STM32F3DISCOVERY]] board.

** Setup Zephyr

Install the Zephyr toolchain, following the [[https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/getting_started/index.html][Getting Started]] guide.

You can install =west= in a virtual environment. Then you will need to
activate this environment and configure the Zephyr base directory:
#+begin_src sh
pyenv activate zephyr_env  # or whatever you are using to change virtualenvs
source ~/zephyrproject/zephyr/zephyr-env.sh  # change this if you installed Zephyr somewhere else
#+end_src

This will define the =ZEPHYR_BASE= environment variable to the Zephyr
base directory. Then you have access to =west='s extensions like
=build=, =flash=, etc.

You will need to do this everytime you want to use =west=.

** Setup the project

In the project directory, run:
#+begin_src sh
cmake -B build -GNinja -DBOARD=stm32f3_disco
ninja -C build
#+end_src

You can also generate the compilation database with:
#+begin_src sh
ninja -C build -t compdb > compile_commands.json
#+end_src

** Flash and monitor

Using =ninja=:
#+begin_src sh
ninja -C build
ninja -C build flash
#+end_src

Using =west=:
#+begin_src sh
west build
west flash
#+end_src

Get the device location with =dmesg= (here =/Dev/ttyACM0=), the open
serial communications with minicom:
#+begin_src sh
minicom --device /dev/ttyACM0
#+end_src
